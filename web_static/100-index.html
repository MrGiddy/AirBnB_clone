                  <p>Fantastic place. It was clean. Adrienne was great (even
                    though we did not meet in person) and everything went super
                    smooth. Location is also great if you like running and
                    something a bit more quiet. I would suggest a car or take into 
                    consideration that you might have to Uber into the city from 
                    the location. Overall, would recommend the place anytime.

                    <b>From Emily, dated April 12th, 2019</b>
                  </h3>
                  <p>My stay at this accommodation was simply delightful. 
                    Not only was the place impeccably clean, but the 
                    attention to detail was exceptional. Although I never 
                    had the pleasure of meeting Bill face-to-face, 
                    his communication was prompt and courteous, making 
                    the check-in process seamless. The peaceful location 
                    was a breath of fresh air, perfect for morning strolls 
                    and unwinding after a busy day. While having a car is 
                    convenient, the public transportation options nearby 
                    made it easy to explore the city without one. Without 
                    hesitation, I would highly recommend this wonderful 
                    retreat to anyone seeking a tranquil getaway.
